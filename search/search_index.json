Each meeting will involve one scientific presentation and discussion. Generally, we suggest a 20-minute power-point style presentation focusing on \u201cwork in progress\u201d. We hope these meetings will provide opportunities to disseminate our research to the CEU, to gain scientific feedback on projects and for generic presentation skills training. If you have a conference presentation coming up, you may wish to practice it in one of these meetings. We hope that over 2020, each member of the CEU will have an opportunity to give a presentation. We plan to rotate the focus of the meetings between general themes of \u201cEpidemiology\u201d, \u201cGenomics\u201d and \u201cBiostatistics\u201d and hope you will be willing to regularly participate in at least one of these themes.
