Each meeting will involve one scientific presentation and discussion. Generally, we suggest a 20-minute power-point style presentation focusing on \u201cwork in progress\u201d. We hope these meetings will provide opportunities to disseminate our research to the CEU, to gain scientific feedback on projects and for generic presentation skills training. If you have a conference presentation coming up, you may wish to practice it in one of these meetings. We hope that over 2020, each member of the CEU will have an opportunity to give a presentation. We plan to rotate the focus of the meetings between general themes of \u201cEpidemiology\u201d, \u201cGenomics\u201d and \u201cBiostatistics\u201d and hope you will be willing to regularly participate in at least one of these themes.

Replace with the actual path to your Unix domain socket and with the target URL. [P,NE,L,QSA]: These are flags that modify the behavior of the RewriteRule: P: Proxy flag. This tells Apache to treat the substitution as a proxy request and forward it to the specified location. NE: No Escape flag. This prevents Apache from escaping special characters in the substitution, useful when substituting URLs. L: Last flag. This indicates that if the current rule matches, no further rules should be processed for this request. QSA: Query String Append flag. This appends the original query string to the substituted URL.
