## Back to the office policy CEU

***23 September 2022***

Considerations:
* Working in the office will have many advantages: creating opportunities to improve creativity, collaboration, efficiency, training, enjoyment.
* Every situation is different, and we try to do our best to accommodate everyone’s wishing as much as possible
* Working from home has many advantages, and we don’t want to lose these.

Hybrid working policy:
* We encourage people to come into the office, preferable at least 60% of their time.
* There will be one CEU day per week where we hope most of the colleagues will be in.
* If someone’s work will require to be in the office because it will be difficult to do from home (at the discretion of the line manager), staff are expected to come in.
* Line managers will work with their team which days they will be in, but will also discuss with their individual team members on exceptions to coming into the office.
* Meetings will have hybrid options (in person combined with video conference)
* Start from 26th September 2022, but acknowledge a transition period.
* This Hybrid working policy is a pilot, with review Q1 2023.
